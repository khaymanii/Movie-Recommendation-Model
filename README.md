# Movie Recommendation Model

The Movie Recommendation System employs the cosine similarity algorithm as part of its content-based filtering approach. 
This algorithm is utilized to measure the similarity between movies based on their content features, such as genre, director, and actors. 
Here's a brief overview of how the cosine similarity algorithm works within the context of this system:

## Cosine Similiarity

Cosine similarity is a metric used to quantify the similarity between two vectors. In the context of the Movie Recommendation System, each movie is represented as a vector where each dimension corresponds to a specific content feature. 
The cosine similarity between two movie vectors is calculated using the cosine of the angle between them.
